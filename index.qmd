## Bio

I’m an environmental scientist, finishing my Masters Degree in Environmental Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University. Currently, I split my time between researching the drivers of light attenuation in Virginia reservoirs, and teaching an undergraduate ecology course. In prior roles, I have worked assessing stream impairments for TMDL creation, creating remote water quality monitoring stations, and monitoring a series of urban streams across Richmond, Va. By training I’m either a limnologist (specializing in light, sediment, and algae interactions) or a hydrologist; professionally, I am interested in freshwater ecology, data analysis, GIS, graphic design, and protecting Virginia's water resources.

On this site I keep a portfolio of representative academic documents, presentations, and my CV/Resume.
